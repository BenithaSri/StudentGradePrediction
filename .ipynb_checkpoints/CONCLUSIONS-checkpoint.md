#  Final Conclusions and Future Directions

---

## üìö Summary of Findings

This project aimed to predict student final grades using academic, behavioral, and demographic features through a combination of regression, classification, and clustering models.

Throughout the project:
- **Linear Regression** served as a simple baseline but struggled due to feature overlap among students, highlighting the limits of using continuous prediction for grade classification.
- **Decision Tree** classifiers provided easily interpretable splits but tended to overfit without parameter tuning.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** handled overlapping features more effectively after normalization and hyperparameter tuning, improving boundary formation between grade categories.
- **KMeans Clustering** revealed natural behavior-based groupings within the data, validating some grade patterns without using label information.
- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy after tuning, balancing bias and variance effectively across grade levels.

##  Key Takeaways

- **Classification models** (particularly SVM and Random Forest) were more suitable than regression for grade prediction.
- **Behavioral factors** like Attendance, Study Hours, and Stress Level played a substantial role in influencing overall performance.
- **Feature overlap** challenges emphasized the importance of model choice and proper preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding).
- **Clustering** offered valuable unsupervised validation, revealing underlying structures in student behavior.

## üöÄ Future Directions

- Explore **advanced ensemble methods** like XGBoost and LightGBM for further improving classification accuracy.
- Apply **feature engineering** by creating interaction terms (e.g., Stress Level √ó Study Hours) to capture nuanced academic behaviors.
- Implement **cross-validation** for more robust model evaluation and generalization.
- Experiment with **deep learning models** (such as MLPs) on larger datasets for richer feature extraction.
- Investigate **real-world deployment possibilities**, such as integrating grade prediction models into educational dashboards to support early intervention strategies.
